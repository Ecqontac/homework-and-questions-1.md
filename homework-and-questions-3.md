# Homework Questions 3 (Homework part 2)

1. TM stands for trademark. The TM symbol (often seen in superscript like this: TM) is usually used in connection with an unregistered mark—a term, slogan, logo, or other indicator—to provide notice to potential infringers that common law rights in the mark are claimed.

2. The R symbol indicates that this word, phrase or logo is a registered trademark for the product or service. It must only be used in the case of registered trademarks and by the owner or licensee. It also must only be used in the regions in which you possess a valid trademark registration.

3. A registered and protected domain name provides you protection against any unauthorized use of your domain name by any person or entity.

4. By law, you need not request permission to use a trademark belonging to another if it is for an editorial or informational use but you do need permission for anything else. Trademark law protects distinctive words, phrases, logos, symbols, slogans, and any other devices used to identify and distinguish products or services in the marketplace.

5. A common law trademark provides protection for a symbol, logo, product name, or other words or marks that identify the source of goods or services before it is registered with the state or federal government.

6. A common law trademark would also not give you the right to prevent any of those new businesses in other states from operating under the same name as yours. In a growing online marketplace, a federal registration possesses the added allure of national protection and extra security for your company.

7. The most common use of the TM symbol is on a new phrase, logo, word, or design that a company plans to register through the USPTO. The symbol can indicate your intent to move forward with obtaining a legal trademark. It also helps stake your claim in the design, alerting competitors that you plan to use it for your business.

8. Attribution, in copyright law, is acknowledgement as credit to the copyright holder or author of a work. ...

   the year of first publication of the copyrighted work; and
   identification of the owner of the copyright, either by name, abbreviation, or other designation by which they are generally known.

10. Copyrights and trademarks protect distinct creations. Generally, copyrights protect creative or intellectual works, and trademarks apply to commercial names, phrases, and logos. ... Trademarks protect the use of a company's name and its product names, brand identity

11. To be protected by copyright, the work must be more than an idea. It must be fixed in a "tangible form of expression." This means the work must be written or otherwise recorded. This is because a copyright does not protect an idea or plan: it protects the expression of that idea or plan.

12. No. In general, registration is voluntary. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created.

13. Legal Proof – Obtaining a registered copyright provides legal proof of ownership, which serves to maximize your damages and minimize your legal burden should you be involved in an infringement lawsuit.

16. There are three types of patents: utility patents, design patents, and plant patents. Each type of patent has its own eligibility requirements and protects a specific type of invention or discovery; however, it's possible for one invention or discovery to potentially have more than one type of patent available for it.

24. It is a complete URL to a file or page. In the absolute path, the protocol is first specified, followed by the domain name (site name). For example: http://www.example.com - this is how the absolute path to a particular website looks.

25. The first difference you'll notice between the two different types of links is that absolute paths always include the domain name of the website, including http://www., whereas relative links only point to a file or a file path.
