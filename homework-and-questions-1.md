# Homework Questions 1 (Homework part 2) Answers

1. Hypertext Markup Language


2. It allows the user to create and structure sections, paragraphs, headings, links, and blockquotes for web pages and applications.


3. An HTML element is an individual component of an HTML document. It represents semantics, or meaning. For example, the title element represents the title of the document. Most HTML elements are written with a start tag (or opening tag) and an end tag (or closing tag), with content in between.


4. An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag.


5. The <html> tag represents the root of an HTML document.

   The <html> tag is the container for all other HTML elements (except for the <!DOCTYPE> tag).

6. An element is a set of opening and closing tags in use. Tags are labels you use to mark up the begining and end of an element. All tags have the same format: they begin with a less-than sign "<" and end with a greater-than sign ">". ... The only difference between an opening tag and a closing tag is the forward slash "/".


7. HTML attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. Attributes are always specified in the start tag
   Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"


8. The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element (the value must be unique within the HTML document). The id attribute is most used to point to a style in a style sheet, and by JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to manipulate the element with the specific id.

9. The id attribute is a unique identifier which is used to specify the document. It is used by CSS and JavaScript to perform a certain task for a unique element. In CSS, the id attribute is used using # symbol followed by id.

10. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.

11. The class attribute specifies one or more classnames for an element. The class attribute is mostly used to point to a class in a style sheet. However, it can also be used by a JavaScript (via the HTML DOM) to make changes to HTML elements with a specified class.

12. The HTML  h1 – h6  elements represent six levels of section headings. <h1> is the highest section level and <h6> is the lowest.

13. The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE , is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.

14. We can say that HTML elements are a set of tags and attributes that define different parts of web documents and inform web browsers how to display them. An HTML document is a text file that contains the tag-based information to publish. It also contains embedded instructions called “Elements”.


15. The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag. HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed. Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

16. The charset attribute of the <meta> element is used to specify the character encoding for the HTML document. You can use the charset attribute on <meta> as well as <script> element. Different charsets include ASCII, ANSI, ISO-8859-1, UTF-8, etc. ISO-8859-1 supports 256 different character codes.


17. charset=UTF-8 stands for Character Set = Unicode Transformation Format-8. It is an octet (8-bit) lossless encoding of Unicode characters. These should shed more light on the understanding in Web Development and Scripting.

18. Encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another.

19. Character encoding is relevant for HTML documents since these are always stored with a specific type of character encoding. This allows a unique assignment of letters, numbers, and symbols of a character set.

20. Unicode is an information technology standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems.

21. Unicode is a single, large set of characters including all presently used scripts of the world, with remaining historic scripts being added. Unicode comes with two main encodings, UTF-8 and UTF-16, both very well designed for specific purposes.

22. UTF-8 is an encoding system for Unicode. It can translate any Unicode character to a matching unique binary string, and can also translate the binary string back to a Unicode character. This is the meaning of “UTF”, or “Unicode Transformation Format.”

23. There are other encoding systems for Unicode besides UTF-8, but UTF-8 is unique because it represents characters in one-byte units.

24. Spatial efficiency is a key advantage of UTF-8 encoding. 

25. The HTML Title element ( <title> ) defines the document's title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored.

26. The <body> tag defines the document's body. The <body> element contains all the contents of an HTML document, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.

27. The h1 element represents a level 1 heading. Headings (from h1 to h6 ) are titles that define implied sections in the document and arrange its contents in a hierarchical structure. When headings are combined with the section element the sections of a document are no longer implied but exactly defined.

28. The HTML < p > element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.

29. The default character set for HTML5 is UTF-8.

30. The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.

    The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the <meta> tag.
